      Remember our insert_separator() function from the "Hello, you!" programs.
      it looked like this

       def insert_separator(s="=")
           print(s,s,s,sep="")

      Using repetition, we can improve insert_separator() so that the number of times the separating character shows up is passed into the function

         1. open Hello_you.py in your editor
         2. Modify the insert_separator() function so that the number of times the separating character shows up is passed into the parameter. it should defaulr to  shows up 30 times.
         3. Modify the calls insert_separator() function so that they pass in an argument to the new parameter.
