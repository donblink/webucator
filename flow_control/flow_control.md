## **Exercise 19**

   1. create all_and_any.py inyour editor
   2. in the main() function, there are calls to all_true() and any_true(),
      but those functions have yet to be written. Complete those functions:
           a. all_true() - should return True if (and only if ) all elements
           in the passed-in iterables evaluate to True.
           b. any_true() - should return True if at least one element in the passed-in iterable evaluates to True.

   3. keep in mind that you want your function to return a value as soon as it can.
   for example , if you passa list of 1,000,000 values to all_true() and the first value is False, the function does not need to continue looping through the listto determine that not all values are true.
